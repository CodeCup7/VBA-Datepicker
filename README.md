 	:small_orange_diamond: Since vba does not have a date picker by default, I decided to create my own. 
  I have been using it in many projects for years without any reservations.
  <br>:small_orange_diamond: The code generates a calendar with clearly marked weekends and the current date. After clicking on the date, the control closes, storing the selected date in memory until the entire vba code is close

## :rocket:Ready to use

To use the date picker, you need to call the <b>Initializable</b> method before the show method and send it a form from which you want to call the control and a textbox that will be updated with the date selected by the user.

This method can be modified at will. It is not necessary to send a form (here it is only about centering the calendar relative to the parent)

It is also not necessary to place the date in the textbox. It can be a CELL cell or a SHAPE shape or any other form.
